**Calculation of correlation coefficient for 2 lists of float numbers** (Crucial thing for *ML/Statistics/Data Science*) - in first list we have values a, in second values b. In order to get their correlation coefficient you should use formula below

**So, for calculating it you should use Pearson's formula:**

**As a result - we are able to describe the correlation using the coefficient. Examples of different coefficient values:**
